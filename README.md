# Hey there!✌️

## About Me
Welcome to my profile. Let me take you on a rollercoaster of a journey through this space of mine😄.

I am Himraj Gogoi,a Web Developer(with proven experience in Front-end Development),a Mobile App Developer currently in my final year of B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

Started my web developement journey back in 2020 with HTML,CSS and Javascript and never looked back. Explored React.js library first for frontend and express.js for backend and exploring this domain for the past 2 years, upgrading myself with a diverse skillset spanning a number of frameworks for both frontend and backend.

I believe thoeretical learning is not sufficient to hone a skill. As such I make personal projects everytime I learn a new technology for cementing what I have learnt. Some of the projects have even been deployed for general public. 

Did a few internships along the way to gain industry level experience and learn what type of skillset is expected from us with my last internship being at IQVIA, India.

The internships so far cover the following technolgies with demonstrative expertise:

▪️Front-end Development

▪️Back-end Development

▪️Android Development 

▪️React.js

▪️Next.js

▪️Angular 2.0

▪️Ionicframework 

▪️Flutter

▪️Asp.net Core.

I de-stress myself in the form of art, reading and writing. Been doing art since I was a kid and love to explore new art forms. Reading has been a relatively new addiction for me, started off with These Hills Called Home by Temsula Aao and since then it has been quite a journey through different genres.

Love to travel and explore the nature.
